        <h2>Pet Room Hotel</h2>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p> The Pet Room Hotel project demonstrates my entrepreneurial and graphic design skills by creating a brand
            identity for a fictional company. Pet Room Hotel's audience includes all pet owners who lack sufficient time
            to care for their pets during travels. This company provides a safe environment and high-quality care for
            customers' beloved pets.
        </p>

        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p> The objective was to create a unique brand and its identity components that would reflect the company's
            values to reach its desired audience.
        </p>



        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>First, I had to come up with a brand identity. I chose to focus on hospitality for pets so my audience would
            be pet owners, mostly middle to higher-class individuals who travel frequently and are too busy to care for
            their pets during that time. Three words that would embody the company's personality would be friendly,
            trustworthy, and caring.
        </p>

        <p>The idea of the logo is that it symbolizes the hotel's hospitality, so it is composed of a house on top of a
            bone. Different colour variations of the logo were then created in Illustrator as shown in figure 4.

        <h3>Application</h3>

        <p>With the logo and colour scheme in mind, I then created some mockups and applications with the company's logo
            on products using Photoshop.

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>While working on this project, one of the challenges I faced was creating a logo that would represent our
            company’s friendly identity while at the same time giving it a professional hotel look. I had to play around
            with only a few colours due to the limited components of the logo. I learned that I don't need a very
            colourful palette to get my message across. By just having the right elements, I can achieve the ideal logo
            depending on the company’s values even with a limited colour scheme.
