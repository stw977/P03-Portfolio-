        <h2>Room Away from Home</h2>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Throughout this project, I created a mobile application prototype that demonstrates a logical user
            interface. This application is based on a simulated database. As a team of three, we decided on a certain
            user demographic and researched their needs during the COVID-19 pandemic.
        </p>

        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>To create an application that allows people to isolate themselves in a designated place safely during COVID.
            It would also help the government reduce the spread of COVID-19, avoid overloading hospitals, and track
            individuals who are doing their self-isolation.
        </p>

       

        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>To do the research, I used Google Forms to conduct UX surveys, which collected demographic information and
            asked close-ended questions related to participants' experience with COVID-19 quarantine/isolation. Then the
            respondents' needs were analyzed through the quantitative data collected.
        </p>

        <p>Based on the user personas and the data collected, together as a group, we designed the basic layout and the
            low-fidelity wireframes.

        </figure>

        <p>Different iterations of medium to high-fidelity wireframes and their style guides were created through Figma.
            The combination of soft complementary colours, the san serif choice of font, and the round corners of my
            first iteration make the application more friendly and aesthetically pleasing.
        </p>

        </figure>

        <p>My focused pages were the home screen and the search pages — map page, calendar, and search results. After
            adding images to the prototype, I decided to use darker complementary colours which match the images better.

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>At the beginning of the project, I spent a lot of time trying to decide on a colour scheme that would match
            the first layouts. However, as I was adding more features, the colours had to change again to match the new
            iterations. I realized the amount of time I spent choosing the colours could have been spent perfecting the
            interface. For future prototyping projects, I would try to focus more on making the interaction features
            more smooth feeling.
